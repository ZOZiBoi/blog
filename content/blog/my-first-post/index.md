FINALLY got my blog set up. Shifted between 5 different themes and finally decided on this one (thank you Nick for the [insightful tutorial](https://www.nickgracilla.com/posts/obsidian-is-my-hugo-cms/)).

Anways,
<div style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
<figure>
<img src="my-notion-face-transparent.png" alt="My Notion avatar" width="300" >
<figcaption>me sorta kinda as a Notion avatar</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

# Hello. 
The purpose of this blog is to just document random stuff that I keep getting myself into and eventually forget what I did. And also to just show random projects that I take on (which is directly proportional to the free time that I have)

You will hear more from me. Soon.
